# RacePrep Development Plan
*Comprehensive roadmap for completing the triathlon training application*

## 🎯 **Current Status: Terminal Design Phase 3 Complete ✅ - Ready for Phase 4**

RacePrep has successfully completed the Terminal Design System migration through Phase 3. All main screens and navigation now feature the retro-futuristic "split-flap" terminal aesthetic inspired by airport departure boards.

**Terminal Design Progress:**
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Foundation & Components (TerminalCard, TerminalButton, feature flags)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Dashboard Widgets (all 8+ widgets migrated to terminal mode)
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Screens & Navigation (Dashboard, Races, Training, Planning, Profile, Nav Bar)
- ⏳ **Phase 4**: Modals & Forms (AuthModal, race modals, goal modals, calculators)
- ⏳ **Phase 5**: Polish & Animation (transitions, split-flap effects, loading states)
- ⏳ **Phase 6**: Testing & QA (cross-browser, mobile, accessibility)
- ⏳ **Phase 7**: Gradual Rollout (feature flags, user testing, full deployment)

**Phase 3 Completion (December 1, 2025):**
- ✅ Dashboard screen with terminal header and background
- ✅ Races screen with terminal-styled search, navigation, and cards
- ✅ Training screen with terminal tabs and calendar
- ✅ Planning screen with terminal mode toggles
- ✅ Profile screen with terminal sections and forms containers
- ✅ Navigation bar with accent-yellow active state and terminal colors

**Next Priority:**
- 🎯 **Phase 4: Modals & Forms** - Migrate all modal dialogs and form inputs to terminal styling
  - AuthModal, race modals, goal modals, training modals
  - Form inputs, buttons, validation states
  - Planning calculators (nutrition, pacing)
  - See `PHASE_4_MODALS_FORMS_PLAN.md` for detailed plan
